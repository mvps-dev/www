What is multi-vendor marketplace software?

Based on our experience with open-source multi-vendor marketplace development, we will guide you through the whole process as partners to make sure it meets all your needs. 


A multi-vendor marketplace platform is basically an eCommerce platform, where many independent vendors can sell their own products. It may cover all the essential features. There are few types of marketplace platforms that we have already worked on with our clients all over the world. Some of the multi-vendor marketplaces do not even look different from classic eCommerce. 
We base our multi-vendor marketplaces on open-source marketplace software.
